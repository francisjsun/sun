Project Sun - A C++ utils library.
===========

## Features ##
1. All features are compatiable with **C++20**.
2. Cross-platform supported(including linux, macOS and windows).
3. **Async**, unlike std::async, it wraps the function into a coresponding async  
verison and has guarantee of running in a thread-pool.
4. **cout**, an async output utility with powerful output formats supported.
5. **utility.h**, a rich utility set. (e.g. `Apply`, `IndexOf::In`, `Invoke<>::for<>::With()`... ).
6. **RangeViewer**, almost a *std::span*, but with a movable _begin_.  
8. **Json**, a json Serializer/Deserializer.
